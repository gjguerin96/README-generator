# README Generator

## Description

I built this application so that I could have a useful tool to fill out READMEs. READMEs are important but tedious to make, so having an application do much of the work for you is very convenient. 

In the process of building it I learned about how to use node.js, and about the potential string literals have when used in combination with inquirer.

## Installation

Requires node.js, inquirer, and fs.

## Usage

See video walkthrough below. Use node index.js to access the file, and then you will be presented with the various sections of the README so you can enter the information you want in each one. The README will be generated with a working table of contents and a link to your github. 

At the end you can select which license you want, or if you want none. If you choose a license, a badge will be added. If you choose none, there will be no badge and the license section will be removed along with the license item from the table of contents.
